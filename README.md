</div>

A Claude Code plugin marketplace with my agent skills. Each skill lives in its own repository, with
its own versions, releases and changelog. This repository only lists them, so Claude Code can
install any of them from one place. The same skills work in Codex, OpenCode, Cursor and other
agents that read Agent Skills.

## Install

| Agent | Command |
|---|---|
| Claude Code 2.1.275 or later | `/plugin install <skill> --marketplace nyxandro/skills` |
| Older Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add nyxandro/skills`, then `/plugin install <skill>@nyxandro` |
| Codex, OpenCode, Cursor and others | `npx skills add nyxandro/<skill>-skill` |

Replace `<skill>` with a name from the table below, for example
`/plugin install prod-recon --marketplace nyxandro/skills`. Every installed skill adds its
description to every session, so install only the ones you use.

<details>
<summary>Updates</summary>

<br>

The catalog pins no versions, so every commit to a skill's repository reaches plugin users as an
update. Run `claude plugin marketplace update nyxandro` and then
`claude plugin update <skill>@nyxandro` in your shell, or turn on auto-update for the catalog under
`/plugin` → Marketplaces.

<details>
<summary>How the catalog works</summary>

<br>

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has one entry per skill that points to the skill's own
  repository. Claude Code reads it when you add the catalog.
- On every push, GitHub runs `claude plugin validate --strict` on the catalog, so a broken entry
  can't quietly break installs for everyone.
- Versions, releases and changelogs live in each skill's repository, not here.

```text
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   the catalog, one entry per skill
.github/workflows/validate.yml    the catalog check on every push
README.md, README.ru.md           this page in English and in Russian
```
